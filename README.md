## Installation

1. Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/Jnavarro15/myMovies.git

2. Install dependencies

npm install 

3. Install Axios

npm install axios

## USAGE and Running APP

For demo purposes I have included my personal TMDB API Key.

However, it's important to note that ideally, users should obtain their own API key if they intend to use the application beyond testing and development.

You can obtain your api key from [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/authentication#api-key-quick-start)

Update this line of code in the App.js within the src folder

const API_KEY = your_api_key_here

Then you can run the app with the following command 

npm start

Enjoy the app!
